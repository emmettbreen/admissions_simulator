# Cornell Admissions Simulator

## 2022

A KNN algorithm with 100% test accuracy that models the admissions process at Cornell University. The algorithm takes in the following features:

Continuous:
- GPA (out of 4.0)
- SAT
Discrete (0 or 1):
- Leadership (are you the head of a club?)
- Athletics (are you on a varsity sport?)
- Volunteering (do you volunteer regularly?)
- Unique Trait (do you have a talent/experience unique to you?)

These features are then scaled and pairwise distances are calculated to determine similarity between applicants. The algorithm can take in a never seen before student, find the 5 students who are most similar, and decipher whether or not the new student can get into Cornell. The dataset was scraped manually from college confidential, so it is limited to 75 points.


## Contributions to Academia
This algorithm was used in my ORIE 3120 final presentation at Cornell University, and was nominated for a Cornell Univeristy Presentation (CUP) Award by the professor. The algorithm contributed to the research paper as follows:
